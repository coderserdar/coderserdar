# About Me

I am a *computer engineer* graduated from **Hacettepe University Computer Science Engineering** in 2009.

Except the lessons in school, I started coding with **Delphi** (*Object Pascal*) programming language. Nowadays, a lot of people think that Delphi is an *ancient* programming language and that's nonsense to write with this language, but I have *special feelings* to this language.

In my opinion **Delphi 7** *IDE* has the *fastest compiler* I've ever seen but now I am interested in [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) and [Freepascal](https://www.freepascal.org/). Because this IDE and compiler is **cross-platform**, you will write *Object Pascal* too and multi language support is easier that Delphi versions.

I talked much about Delphi, but I earn money from [.NET Technologies](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) about *9 years*. I like to write code with **C#** language and the other technologies. I am writing generally *web projects* like *ERP* solutions or automation systems

I am working at [Agartha Teknoloji](https://www.agarthateknoloji.com.tr/) as a **Team Lead**. I am designing **ERP** projects for *governmental organizations*, analysing it, documenting it and finally coding in it.
